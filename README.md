This project visualizes NYC taxi trip data using Unity3D. It provides a 3D representation of taxi pickups and drop-offs on a map of New York City. The project aims to demonstrate how to parse and visualize geospatial data within a 3D game engine.

Open Yellow Taxi Data used: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2009-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/f9tw-8p66/about_data

## Features
- **Data Parsing:** Reads taxi trip data from a JSON file.
- **3D Visualization:** Uses Unity to visualize pickup and drop-off points as spheres in a 3D space.
- **Dynamic Scaling:** Adjusts the visualization scale for better representation within the scene.

## Prerequisites
- Unity 2019.4 or higher
- Basic knowledge of C# and Unity
- NYC Taxi trip data in JSON format
